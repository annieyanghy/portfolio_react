       <p className="text-2xl mb-12">Since launching the product at My Ad Center in 2022, I've been on a mission to continuously improve its features and accessibility. The core of my work has been centered on giving users more agency over their ads, ensuring they have the tools and control they need to manage their campaigns effectively. Every update, big or small, has been a step toward a more intuitive, powerful, and user-friendly platform, reflecting my commitment to a product that truly serves its users.
